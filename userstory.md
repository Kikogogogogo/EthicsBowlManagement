Judges


Jenny has volunteered to judge for an upcoming Ethics Bowl event. Before the event, she wants to check the scoring platform to make sure she has access to the matches that she is supposed to be judging. During the event, she wants to be able to quickly log in and access the matches she’s supposed to judge. She needs to be able to easily understand the scoring criteria and enter her scores without being distracted from the match. And she needs to be able to submit those scores at the end of the match and then move onto her next match.



Moderators


Maddy is a moderator at an upcoming Ethics Bowl event. She has been provided with a script that tells her how the match goes, what she will say, and how what instructions she should give to the teams and the judges. Maddy needs to be able to log in and see which matches she’s assigned to. During the match, she needs to be able to see who the judges and teams are so that she can introduce them. She also needs to be able to update the ‘match step,’ which allows the tournament organizers to see how far along the match is. Once the match is complete, she needs to be able to see the submitted judge scores and the outcome of the match so that she can announce the winner before moving on to her next match.



Administrators


Janan is a tournament organizer for an upcoming ethics bowl event. Before the event, he needs to be able to create an event on the platform, deciding how many rounds there will be, adding the teams, moderators and judges and assigning them to matches. He also needs to be able to edit these assignments, adding and removing teams, judges and moderators and changing their match assignments. Janan is running a round robin style tournament, which means that he can decide on the match pairings in advance, in all rounds except the semi-final and final rounds. The judges and moderators for the semi-finals/finals can be decided in advance.


During the tournament, Janan needs to be able to view the progress of each match (i.e., he can see the ‘match step’ for each match, controlled by that match’s moderator) so that he can adjust the schedule for the day if matches are running late. He also needs to be able to see the standings and all relevant information about the teams and their performances (their wins and losses, their total votes, their total points and point differentials). He should also be able to see the scores assigned by each judge for each match. He might also have to help judges and moderators log into scoring platform and ensure that they have access to their matches. When it comes to the semi-final and final rounds, Janan needs to be able to look at the standings and then assign teams to matches based on their performance.


The following admin profiles represent features which would be nice to have but which are inessential.



Ellen is also organizing an Ethics Bowl tournament. Ellen needs to be able to do the same things as Janan, with one difference which is that she is running a Swiss-style tournament instead of a round robin tournament. This means that Ellen can decide the team pairings for round one in advance but not the other rounds, since the pairings will depend on the outcome of the previous rounds according to the Swiss rules. Calculating the pairings is complex, and Ellen needs to be able to see who should be playing who according to the Swiss rules quickly. She can then use her own judgment (about matters like conflicts of interest between teams and judges) to adjust the pairings as needed and enter them into the schedule for the next round.



Jeff works for the Ethics Bowl and is involved in the planning of multiple events. He will do some of the same things as Ellen and Janan, adding judges and moderators to events, scheduling matches, and so on. He also wants to use the platform to check on the outcomes of multiple events, looking at the standings to see how teams did (in terms of rank, wins, votes, point differentials, and so on) to make decisions about, for example, which teams should advance to the championship event. He also would like to use the data from these events to better understand how the rubric is working, how judges are behaving, how different teams are performing, and so on. He would like to be able to download the data from an event in a spreadsheet (like a .csv) so that he can open it in Excel, or use Python or R to analyze and visualize the data.
